Python to exe setup

1) first of make sure the computer you're using has py2exe
you check this by going to C:/Python27 and looking for 
'Removepy2exe.exe' or 'py2exe-wininst.log'

2)Next create a setup.py file

3)inside the file make sure it looks like this:

"""
from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe, sys, os

sys.argv.append('py2exe')

def setup_exe(fil):
    setup(
        options = {'py2exe':{'bundle_files':1}},
        windows = [{'script': fil}],
        zipfile = None,
)

setup_exe(raw_input("Enter the file name including the extension:\n").strip())
"""

4)This will create a an executeable file in the dist folder with the same 
name as the python script. This file will be able to run on its own from any
location.
